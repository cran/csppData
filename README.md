**csppData** is an R package that contains the Correlates of State
Policy data assembled by Marty P. Jordan and Matt Grossmann. Use the
associated [cspp](https://github.com/correlatesstatepolicy/cspp) package
to subset the data by states and years, create map + panel
visualizations, export citations to common file formats (e.g., .bib),
and more.
